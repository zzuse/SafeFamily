# SafeFamily
Initially, my son wasn't a fan of this website because I was managing his browsing history and setting time limits for certain sites using scheduled tasks. However, I've since integrated many more features, including daily homework planning, personal resume creation, converting outlines of courses he's interested in into web pages, and using an LLM (Large Language Model) to search and manage a local database. Some of these features are still under development, and the website itself will be restructured. But I know I need this site, because I've become a heavy user myself.
